# Database-1
Project in Database Design I 

The project gives you the opportunity to practice a relational database design process from A to Z, from reading the customer specification, which might be redundant, vague or even inconsistent; to conceptual modeling using ER diagrams; to creating, populating and querying the database in an RDBMS; to writing applications accessing
and modifying the stored data.

Your group has been asked to help with a project for AltOnline AB, a new Swedish company which, inspired by the tremendous success of Amazon.com, Inc., wants to become a market leader in online sales in Sweden.The project is rather large and your part is to design and implement a database system for its online store.
